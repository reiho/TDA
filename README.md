# Topological Analysis of Various Genetic Data

The main purpose of this work is to consider topological methods as a tool for high-dimensional biological data analysis and dimension reduction. This requires developing an algorithm for such data, validating parameters, and assessing results. There is a lot of successful work with TDA applications on medical data, but they lack information on how to choose parameters to get decent results.
